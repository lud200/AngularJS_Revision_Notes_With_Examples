    Hello World!
    <!-- Key up event is set to an element when user releases a key on the keyboard.
		It can be attached to an element but the event is only sent to the element 
		that has focus. 

		If key press anywhere need to be caught, it is useful to attach the element
		to the document object. Because of event bubbling, all key presses will make
		their way up the DOM to the document object unless explicitly specified.

		var textInputElement = document.getElementById('textInput');
		textInputElement.addEventListener('keyup', function(){
		console.log('Got key up event');
