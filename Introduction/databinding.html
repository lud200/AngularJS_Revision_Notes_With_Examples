<!-- Every HTMl attribute specific to angular js is a directive and has a 
	specific role in angularJS application. 

	HTML page is known as "template" because its not the final version of what
	will be rendered on the web browser visible to user. 

	ng-app directive marks the DOM elements that contain the angularJS application

	We can initialize the variables with ng-init directive. 
	Data binding can be specified in two different ways:
	using curly braces, using ng-bind directive. ng-bind="var-name"

	We have two way data binding when a model is bound to HTML element that can both 
	change and display the value of a variable. 

	We can have more than one HTML element bound to same variable. 

	We use ng-model directive to bind model variable to the HTML element that can 
	not only display the value but also can change it.
