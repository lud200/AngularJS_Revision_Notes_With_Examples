<!-- In Angular JS, everything has an associated scope. 
	Scopes are organized in a hierarchy. 

	There is a root scope($rootScope) which is the parent of
	all the scopes in an angularJS application and there are scopes
	created by some directives. 

	Whenever a scope creating directive is encountered in the DOM tree, 
	a new scope is created.

	Instead of defining model variable directly on $rootScope, we can 
	group them in the controller using $scope argument. 

	Controller can be defined with the help of "ng-controller" directive
	specifying the name of Javascript variable representing the controller. 

	A controller creates new scope, so we can define our model variables
	on that scope. We can also define functions on $scope object. 

	the $scope is associate with the controller. A scope created by angularJS
	is made available to our controller function through Dependency Injection. 

	Dependency Injection:

	Dependency Injection means that we declare that our funciton depends on the 
	$scope object and AngularJS should have to assure that the variable is available
	to use inside the function.
